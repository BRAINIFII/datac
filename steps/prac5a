Implement BGP Communities
Instructions
Build the Network and Configure Basic Device Settings and Interface Addressing
In Part 1, you will set up the network topology and configure basic settings and interface addressing on routers.
Cable the network as shown in the topology.
Attach the devices as shown in the topology diagram, and cable as necessary.
Configure basic settings for each router.
Console into each router, enter global configuration mode, and apply the basic settings and interface addressing. A command list for each router is listed below for initial configuration.
Configure and Verify Multi-Protocol BGP on all Routers
In Part 2, you will configure and verify Multi-Protocol BGP on all routers to achieve full connectivity between the routers. The text below provides you with the complete configuration for R1. You will use this to inform your configuration of R2 and R3. The configuration being used here is not meant to represent best practice, but to assess your ability to complete the required configurations.
On R1, create the core BGP configuration.
On R1, configure the IPv4 unicast address family.
On R1, configure the IPv6 unicast address family.
Verify that MP-BGP is operational.
Configure and Verify BGP Communities on all Routers
Configure all routers to send community information.
Configure and verify the effect of the no-export community.
Add private community information to routes advertised by R1.
Configure community-based route filtering and manipulation.
